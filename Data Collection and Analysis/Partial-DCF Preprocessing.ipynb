    "# Partial - Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Model - Machine Learning Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "After compiling various valuation metrics, and conducting exploratory analysis to generate insights into the SaaS industry, I came across something called the discounted cash flow model. Many of the valuation metrics surrounding debt, enterprise value, and revenue had strong correlations to other indications of company growth and value, so I found that a partial DCF model could help throughout my valuation research. \n",
    "\n",
    "A discounted cash flow model is a financial model that uses sensitivity analysis and free cash flows to predict a company's value in terms of TODAY'S money value. However, a DCF model relies on heavy assumptions. In particular, the most important assumption is the forecasting of unlevered free cash flows, or cash flows BEFORE accounting for interest payments, representing money available to all debt and equity holders. This value can paint a very clear picture of a company's intrinsic value. Afterwards, these forecasted values are \"discounted\" using a ratio that is calculated by an individual investor, with the output of a DCF model being an overall enterpise value. (If you remember, enterprise value is calculated using debt levels and market cap, but a DCF analysis can generate a more accurate enterprise, or present value.)\n",
    "\n",
    "With all the data collected so far, my goal with this project is to make sure that investors have a tool that can help them create DCF models for company valuation. In particular, I want to take out the assumption in forecasting, by using machine learning models to predict unlevered free cash flows. Let's go over how I preprocessed the information needed to create a useful machine learning model to predict UFCFs."

    "We collect the data required for the unlevered free cash flows using the basic formula: UFCF = EBIT × (1 − T) + Depreciation and amortization − Change in working capital − Capital expenditures. We want to use this information ALONG with our valuation metrics and other information to feed into our model. Once again, we use yfinance's API to get this data. We are also aiming to get historical information for each of these factors (annually) so that when we do create a machine learning model, it can easily make predictions based on historical trends. Ideally, the valuation metrics collected previously would be historical as well, but due to software and tool limitations, I could only get historical information for the UFCF factors, UFCF and non-ratio factors.\n"
